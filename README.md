# HeavenSimulation
C# Applied object-oriented programming

Had to make a project in which there would be some of the requirements (http://uosis.mif.vu.lt/~vytautasa/TOP/ first task), but we could choose a thing we would be recreating. After many days of thinking I chose Heaven. So this is my interpretation of the task.

This was my first ever project with C#, so there I tried to do as many things as I could, but it wasn't very difficult.
